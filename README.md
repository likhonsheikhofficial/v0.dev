1. **Describe or Upload** - Explain what you want to build or upload a design mockup
2. **Generate Options** - The AI engine creates initial versions of your application
3. **Customize** - Refine the output using natural language instructions
4. **Export Code** - Get clean, production-ready code to integrate into your project

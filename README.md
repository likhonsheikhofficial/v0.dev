## üåü Highlight: Use v0 System Prompts with Any AI Model

**Get the full v0 system prompts directly from our repository!**

You can now use the same system prompts that power v0.dev with any compatible AI model. This allows you to experiment with v0-like capabilities in your preferred environment:

```bash
# Direct link to v0 system prompts
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/likhonsheikhofficial/v0.dev/refs/heads/main/System/Prompts/v0.txt
```

### Example Usage with Different Models

#### Python (Together API)
```python
from together import Together

# Initialize the client
client = Together()

# Get v0 system prompt
import requests
v0_prompt = requests.get("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/likhonsheikhofficial/v0.dev/refs/heads/main/System/Prompts/v0.txt").text

# Create completion with v0 system prompt
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B-free",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": v0_prompt},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Create a simple product card with an image, title, price, and add to cart button"}
    ]
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

#### TypeScript (OpenAI API)
```typescript
import { OpenAI } from 'openai';
import fetch from 'node-fetch';

async function generateUIWithV0Prompt() {
  // Initialize the client
  const openai = new OpenAI({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  });

  // Get v0 system prompt
  const response = await fetch('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/likhonsheikhofficial/v0.dev/refs/heads/main/System/Prompts/v0.txt');
  const v0Prompt = await response.text();

  // Create completion with v0 system prompt
  const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4",
    messages: [
      { role: "system", content: v0Prompt },
      { role: "user", content: "Create a login form with email and password fields" }
    ],
  });

  console.log(completion.choices[0].message.content);
}

generateUIWithV0Prompt();
```

#### cURL
```bash
# First, save the v0 prompt to a file
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/likhonsheikhofficial/v0.dev/refs/heads/main/System/Prompts/v0.txt > v0_prompt.txt

# Then use it in your API call
curl https://api.together.xyz/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOGETHER_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "'$(cat v0_prompt.txt)'"},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Design a simple navigation bar with logo, links, and dark mode toggle"}
    ]
  }'
```

Simply copy the contents from the link above and use it as a system prompt with your favorite AI model to unlock similar web development capabilities!
